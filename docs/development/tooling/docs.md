# Documentation

Reading, writing, and maintaining documentation is an important part of any project. This section will help you get started with the documentation for MindSpaces. The documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `docs` directory. The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is a static site generator. The documentation is built and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Layout

:::info

If you feel like your page doesn't fit into any of these categories, you can always create a new category. However, it is recommended that you try to fit your page into one of the existing categories first. If you do feel like you need to create a new category, please ask first.

:::

The documentation is organized into several sections, there are three top level categories: [Research](/docs/research/index.md), [Design](/docs/design/index.md) and [Development](/docs/development/index.md). Outside of these categories there are also a few top level documentation pages: [Introduction](/docs/intro.md), [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/index.md) and the [Glossary](/docs/glossary.md). When adding a new page, it should be added to one of these categories.

So, what category should you add your page to? The categories are meant to be broad and general. If you are unsure which category to add your page to, you can always ask. However, a good rule of thumb is the following examples:

- **Research:** This category is suitable for pages that cover research activities related to MindSpaces. It includes things like market research, audience research, and technology research. Use this category if your page is focused on exploring a problem, identifying user needs, or investigating new technologies.

- **Design:** This category is suitable for pages that cover the design aspect of MindSpaces. It includes things like user experience design, software design, and graphic design. Use this category if your page is focused on the visual and interactive aspects of the project, and how users will interact with the software. This category is also used for designing the software architecture.

- **Development:** This category is suitable for pages that cover the development aspect of the software project. It includes things like software architecture, programming, testing, and deployment. Use this category if your page is focused on the technical details of building and deploying the software.
