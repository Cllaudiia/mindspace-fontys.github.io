# Tooling

We use a lot of different tools to develop MindSpaces. This section contains
information about the tools that we use to develop MindSpaces. Both how to
install them, how we use them and why we use them.

## Git

For version control we use Git. Git is a version control system. It allows you
to keep track of changes to the codebase. Just as important, it allows you to
collaborate with other developers.

### Installation

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to the official Git for Windows website

        downloaded file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the prompts in the Git installer to
        complete the installation. By default, Git
        will install to C:\Program Files\Git.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the installation process, you may
        be prompted to select components to
        install. Make sure that "Git Bash Here"
        and "Git GUI Here" are selected if you
        want to use these tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the installation is complete, you can
        open Git Bash to use Git on your Windows
        machine. You can find Git Bash in the
        Start menu under "Git".

      </li>
      <li>
        Install Homebrew if you don't have it
        already. Type the following command and
        press enter:
        <CodeBlock language="bash">
          /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL

      </li>
    </ol>
    That's it! You now have Git installed on your macOS
    machine using Homebrew.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, to verify that Git has been installed correctly, open Git Bash and type the following command:

```powershell
git --version
```

This command will display the current version of Git and verify that it has been
installed correctly. And that's it! You now have Git installed on your Windows
machine.

## Node

Node is a JavaScript runtime environment. It allows you to run JavaScript code
outside of a browser. We use Node to build our frontend for MindSpaces.
