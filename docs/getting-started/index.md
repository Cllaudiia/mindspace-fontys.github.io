# Getting Started

Before you can start developing, you need to setup your development environment. This section will help you do that. MindSpaces uses a lot of different technologies, so it can be a bit overwhelming at first. But don't worry, we will guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start developing, you need to install the neccesary tooling:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Git is a version control system. It allows you to keep track of changes to the codebase. It also allows you to collaborate with other developers. We use Git to manage the codebase.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. We use Node.js to run the server.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker is a containerization tool. It allows you to run applications in isolated containers. We use Docker to run the codebase.

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. We use Docker Compose to run the codebase.

For more information, please read the [Tooling](../development/tooling/index.md) page.

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

The first step is to clone the repository. You can do this by running the following command:
