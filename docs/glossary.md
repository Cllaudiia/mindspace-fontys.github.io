# Glossary

:::info

The glossary is organized alphabetically, so you can quickly find the definition you need. Each definition includes a brief explanation of the term or concept, along with any related terms or concepts that may be helpful to know.

This page contains definitions for common terms and concepts used in the MindSpaces documentation. We understand that technical terms and jargon can be confusing, especially for those new to the field, so we have created this glossary to help make our documentation more accessible and easier to understand.

### API

An API is an application programming interface. An API is a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

### Microservice

A microservice is a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservice architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. - For more information, please visit the [Microservices Research](/docs/research/architecture/microservices.md) page.
